# CapitalCase.C++
Make the first letter in a word capitalized and the rest lowercase. Works for whole sentences.  Written in C++.

# Usage
This program only works from the command line. When using it from the command line, use the argument "-c" followed by the sentence you want to change in double quotes.

Example: .\CapitalCase.C.exe -c "hello world" will produce an output stating "Hello World".

# Platforms
Compiled releases are available on Windows and Linux. They were compiled on Windows 11 and Debian 11. I don't know what their hard cut-off is, though, since I only tested it on the ones I compiled with.
